This is the latest gem5 simulator.


It is expected to be modified.

the first step is to build a simple merkle tree in it.It has been completed.
the merkel tree file is stored in ./src/merkle_tree
I create two Class node/tree to manage the simple tree

the second step is to expand a single merkel tree into a forest.It has been completed.
I expand the Class Forest to manage the multiple trees operation
Besides, I construct the Class MMT_Root to define the structure of MMT detailed by Penglai essays.

the next step is to build the multiple nodes in Gem5,such as local nodes and remote nodes.
I strived to firstly complete the simplest interaction: send and receive.
